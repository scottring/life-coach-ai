## **ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation**

### **State Management**
```typescript
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<1 | 3 | 5 | 7>(7); // Default to weekly
```

### **Dynamic Day Filtering**
```typescript
const getVisibleDays = () => {
  if (!calendarWeek) return [];
  if (viewMode === 7) return calendarWeek.days;
  return calendarWeek.days.slice(0, viewMode);
};
```

### **Responsive Grid Layout**
```typescript
style={{ gridTemplateColumns: `120px repeat(${viewMode}, 1fr)` }}
```

### **Smart Navigation Logic**
```typescript
const navigateWeek = (direction: 'prev' | 'next') => {
  const current = new Date(currentWeek);
  const delta = direction === 'next' ? viewMode : -viewMode;
  current.setDate(current.getDate() + delta);
  setCurrentWeek(current.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
